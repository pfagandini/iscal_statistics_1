The ICU has capacity of 6 patients, the others, are derived to the nearest hospital. Assess the validity of the following sentences:\n\nThe probability that, on a given day, there is no need to transfer any patient is 0.8893.Sol\nThe most likely number of patients arriving daily to the ICU is 6.Sol\nThe probability that, on a given day, arrive 5 patients, given that in the previous day only 2 patients arrived, is 0.1563.Sol\nThe probability that, in 5 days, at least 15 patients arrive to the ICU is 0.8435.Sol\nTo ensure that approx. 97% of the time (days) there are no transfers, it is necessary to increase the capacity in 4 more beds.Sol"
